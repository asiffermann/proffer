excerpt: "Proffer Azure common abstractions."

This library provides common abstractions for any Proffer provider connected to Azure Storage (like [Proffer.Storage.Azure.Blobs](../../storage/azure/blobs) or Proffer.Events.Azure.Queues).

There is not much here until the configuration will be shared across all different projects.
